# My Learning Board
A lightweight React + NodeJS application for creating a customized learning plan.

## TODOS
#### Short Term ( Somewhat ordered )
* Better define the domain around a learning plan
* Use a local MongoDB/NoSQL database for development
* Style the measurables and new learning goal screens
* Make the welcome message go away, store this state if it's a user in our system
* Fix right hand side of navbar (is a non-working hamburger menu at smaller resolutions)

#### Long Term
* Get this up in AWS
* Investigate tagging (https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/tag/)
